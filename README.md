# Full-stack frameworks milestone project

This is project management web application which provides companies with a simple and effective means of informing and updating 
their clients on the progress of ongoing projects. The premise is that a company would white-label the application, open its own 
administrators account, and invite its clients to set up their own account.

From here, the hosting firm and their clients will have access to their own unique dashboards, where they can add, update and 
manage the status of new jobs as required. The jobs held within a client's dashboard is only accessible by them and the administrator, 
meaning the hosting firm can update the client on the project through consistent updates, while the client has freedom to update the 
scope and prioritisation of projects.

A project will be closed as soon as it is signed off and the client has paid the project fee, which is carried out via the application's 
payment feature. Users also have access to a blog, the contents of which is visible to all users of the platform. Here the hosting firm 
will post updates regarding the services that they offer in newsletter-type format, while clients are invited to post testimonials, all 
of which can be upvoted by other users. Clients also have access to a direct messaging platform between themselves and the administrator 
to discuss projects.

## UX

This application was developed with the needs of two particular types of users in mind: SMEs and freelancers looking for a free and simple 
way to manage their workload and engage with their clients, and the clients themselves. This can be summarised with a number of user stories:

- As an SME/freelancer, I want to adopt a cloud-based scheduling platform, so that I can better manage my workload
- As an SME/freelancer, I want to invite my clients to access this platform, so that I can keep them updated on the progress of work
- As an SME/freelancer, I want to encourage discourse between my clients and my organisation, to further promote our services
- As a client that outsources, I want continuous updates on the progress of outstanding work, so I can ensure deadlines are met
- As a client that outsources, I want a simple way to update the scope and prioritisation of projects, so that my business needs are met
- As a client that outsources, I want project progress and payment to be documented in the same place, for a more cohesive engagement
